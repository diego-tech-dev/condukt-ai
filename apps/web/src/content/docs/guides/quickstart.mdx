title: Quickstart Diagnosis
description: Diagnose a broken pipeline run using trace-only evidence.

## Flow

1. Run `pnpm --filter condukt-ai quickstart:broken`.
2. Open `packages/core/trace.quickstart.json`.
3. Find the first task with `status: "error"`.
4. Read `error_code` and `contract_issues`.

Expected failure boundary:

- task: `draft`
- error code: `CONTRACT_OUTPUT_VIOLATION`
- contract path: `claims`

## Why this is deterministic

`condukt-ai` records contract failures at execution boundary time, not as inferred post-processing. This keeps diagnosis reproducible between local and CI runs.
