## OpenAI provider

Use `createOpenAIProvider()` and model-specific settings inferred from the selected model.

## Anthropic provider

Use `createAnthropicProvider()` for Claude-family JSON text responses.

## Provider-model typed safety

`llmTask` infers `modelSettings` from provider + model combination and rejects invalid settings at compile time.
