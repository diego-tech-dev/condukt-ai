# Branding Prompt Provenance

These assets follow a shared prompt direction for consistency:

- **Brand**: `condukt-ai` (lowercase only)
- **Visual direction**: editorial + technical, geometric systems, restrained gradients
- **Palette anchors**: teal `#0D7D6F`, blue `#056EA8`, warm paper neutrals
- **Constraints**: no purple palette bias, no mascot, no glossy 3D effects

## Prompt specs used for asset design

1. **Logo**
- "Design a lowercase `condukt-ai` wordmark with a geometric orchestration glyph, premium editorial-tech styling, flat vector language, and high legibility on light backgrounds."

2. **Hero illustration**
- "Create a clean orchestration dashboard scene showing parallel task nodes, deterministic flow lines, and a trace panel in a modern editorial-tech style."

3. **Contracts illustration**
- "Show left-to-right contract validation handoff between task payload and validated output, using structured cards, soft geometry, and clear flow arrows."

4. **Traces illustration**
- "Represent trace-first debugging with a dark trace console and highlighted error boundaries, preserving a minimal non-gimmicky visual language."

5. **Retries illustration**
- "Visualize retry/backoff control loops with circular directional flow and timing cues, in calm, precise, technical aesthetics."

## Generation note

The current repository environment did not have `OPENAI_API_KEY` configured during this implementation pass.
Assets were rendered in-repo as deterministic vector/bitmap files using these prompt specifications as the canonical art direction.
